1.1 Product
In today's fast paced and hectic lifestyle people find themselves overworked and overburdened. Time
has become one the most the most prized luxuries of life. In such conditions people find it very
difficult to complete their daily chores and a simple trip for grocery shopping becomes a burden.
People are in dire need of a service that allows them to fulfill their grocery requirements from the
comfort of their homes. Unfortunately, all the existing delivery services tend to be overpriced,
unviable for small quantity of orders and require continuous input for recurring order needs.
“DeliverU” aims to solve all these issues and provide relief to such individuals.

Our product aims to lower the delivery charges by allocating specific slots for drivers to make rounds
of predefined regions. The time slots will be specifically planned according to peak demand hours.
This way multiple orders would be handled in a single round which would allow us to provide much
lower delivery costs as well as save time for driver. Moreover, our product will provide users with
the facility to add recurring orders for a time slot which will be delivered to them on daily basis
without having to place orders daily.

cheap and convenient delivery service. The product will scale with time, but it will accomplish the
following tasks at all stages:

• Allow the customer to make recurring orders which would be delivered daily without
requiring continuous inputs daily.
• Allow the customers to choose from a variety of grocery items of daily use and place an order
from a wide variety of local popular restaurants.
• Allow the admins to manage the system components like regions, time slots and order items.
• Allow admins to view system analytics to make business decisions.

The end goal of the product is to create the opportunity for a profitable and scalable business while
facilitating busy individuals to fulfill their daily grocery requirements. The product aims to achieve
the following.
